Everything that has been done for this game demo using both Blueprints and C++:

- 3D source converted into true first-person through scripted horizontal camera movement.
- Sprinting with a depleting stamina that recharges when the player is not running.
- Gun clipping to player's hand, following the camera, with a basic aim system that significantly reduces vertical recoil.
- Mouse-based raycast shooting with sound effects and recoil. Few basic dynamic surfaces (wood, stone, metal) implemented.
- Enemy able to navigate NavMesh-defined area.
- Enemy able to detect player when they are in their frontal line of sight, and pursue them.
- Several personally-made 3D Blender meshes for weapons to be implemented into the game, present in the level.
